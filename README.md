In this publication we will try to understand how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either smiling or non-smiling. This will include working with R and unpacking some of the python libraries like Tensorflow and Keras in R. So, letâ€™s drive on the lane of Machine Learning on our convertible and integrated platform R.
